          <h4>How to prepare:</h4>
          <p>First off, I know that the test can be a little daunting to start off with. Thoughts rush through your mind such as "Where do I start?", "How will I know I'll pass?", and "Will I be waisting my time attempting to take the test?"</p>
          <p>These thoughts are all normal and expected when trying to understand something that you simply don't know all that much about. Through trial and error you will succeed! The main function of this site is to help you know if you're ready for your Written Test so you don't have to go into and wait at the DMV and not be ready.</p>

          <h4>How to study for the California Written Test:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Analyze where you are in the process of becoming a drive and understand what you need to know to pass the test.<br> Do you maybe already know some of the laws of the road?</li>
            <br>
            <li>Think of the ways that you can learn the material that you don't know yet.<br> I'd suggest going through the <a class="text-center" target="blank" href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/web/eng_pdf/dl600.pdf">2020 California Driver Handbook PDF</a> and looking through it maybe one or twice to sharpen your knowledge on the subject.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Next use that newfound knowledge and test yourself with the test that's been created for you. <br> The test has been created to mimic the California Written Test and uses similar scoring measures to identify if you would have passed or failed the test.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Lastly if you failed the test, go through these steps again until you're sure of yourself and ready to take the California Written Test in person.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2 class="text-center">Good Luck on your test!</h2>
